## **Result**
Thus, the **voltage series feedback amplifier** is designed and constructed.  
The following parameters are calculated:

| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | =100Hz | =100MHz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | 3MHz= | =1MHz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl =2.9999 \) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 0.9999\) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 26.5dB\) | \( A'{v(mid)} =25.5dB \) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point |23.5dB  |  22.5dB|
---
**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the voltage-series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
